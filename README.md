<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>We are Mow Mow Inc, a group of Georgia Tech seniors that worked together to create the basis for developing tools to distinguish mowed vs unmowed grass for an autonomous lawnmower.
<br><br>
We created tools to label images of the different types of grass we came across and build convolution neural network to trained said images and test the neural network to see how well it performs in the real world. 
<br><br>
Disclaimer: the group name was inspired <strike>gracefully</strike> by  Mario Kart's Moo Moo Farm stage.

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>
  This program consists of a tool to capture and label images according to its grass status: 
  <i>Mowed, Unmowed, Unknown, Irrelevant</i>. 
  The program consist of the following classes to work:
  
  <h3>dataCollection.py</h3>
  <h3>mainGUI.py</h3>
